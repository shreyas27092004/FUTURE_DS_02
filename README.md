- **Spend** – Amount spent on ads.  
- **Impressions** – How many times ads were shown.  
- **Clicks** – Engagement measure.  
- **CTR %** – `Clicks ÷ Impressions`.  
- **CPC** – `Spend ÷ Clicks`.  
- **ROI %** – `Approved Conversions ÷ Spend`.

##  Tools & Skills
- **Power BI** → Dashboard design & storytelling.  
- **Python (Pandas, Jupyter Notebook)** → Data preprocessing.  
- **Excel/CSV** → Raw dataset handling.  
- **Data Visualization** → KPIs, trends, and insights.  

---

##  Insights & Recommendations
- Campaigns with **higher CTR** contributed most to ROI.  
- Spend was concentrated in few campaigns → opportunity to rebalance budget.  
- CPC trend indicates efficiency fluctuations across dates.  
- Future campaigns can optimize **target audience (age/gender)** for better ROI.
